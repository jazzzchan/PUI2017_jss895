### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

Fat loss from Exercise=E

Fat loss from Diet=D

Null Hypothesis: Exercise is equally or more effective than diet to lose fat (as percentage of body mass) compared with the control sample.

Alternative Hypothesis: Exercise is significantlty not equally or more effective than diet to lose fat (as percentage of body mass) compared with the control sample.

H0: E>=D

H1: E<D

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children at ages 1, 2, 3, and 4 years of age.

Children from smoking mothers test scores= CFSM

Children from Non-Smoking Mothers test scores= CFNM

Null hypothesis: Childrend between ages 1 and 4 borned from smoking mothers (10 or more cigarrettes a day) have non significant difference average IQ test scores than Children between the same ages borned from non-smoking mothers in the sample.

Alternative Hypothesis: Childrend between ages 1 and 4 borned from smoking mothers (10 or more cigarrettes a day) have significantly different average IQ test scores than Children between the same ages borned from non-smoking mothers in the sample.

H0: CFSM=CFNM

H1: CFSM<CFNM or CFSM>CFNM


**Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data the incidence of diabetes for the US population.

H0: There is no significant spatial correlation between diabetes and the location of a subject.

H1: There is significant spatial correlation between diabetes and the location of a subject.
