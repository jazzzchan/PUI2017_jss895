### For the first assignment I had to work with Marium's repository. The pull request was accepted.

### For assignment number 2 I worked with Prince and with Jack, in order to have the three tests on the table. We had some trouble identifying the control variable for the logistic test.

### For assignments 3 and 4 I worked with Prince, Juli√°n and Sarah. For assignment 3 we had some trouble understanding the Chi Square part, although when we found the function in Federica's repository, everything was clear. For assignment 4 we had issues understanding how to tell if a station is located in manhattan or brooklyn, in the end we just used a function that separated depending on the coordinates. This made the data dirty because it was not possible to perfectly set a division for one or the other borough.
