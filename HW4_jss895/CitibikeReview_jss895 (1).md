# Recomendations

### 1. There is no clear question:
Although you can see a hypothesis, and you can infer what could the question be, it is better to clearly state it. I would recommend something like: Is the ratio of male bikers during nightime (19.00-5.00) / men biking during daytime (5.00-19.00) significantly (95% confidence level) bigger than the ratio of female bikers during nightime / female bikers during daytime?

### 2. The hypothesis could be stated more clearly
Although there is a stated hypothesis the drafting could be better, in order to making it easier to understand. Also I recommend including a significance level at which the hypothesis will be tested. Finally I think it is better to rename what is called plainly "hypothesis" into "alternative hypothesis", so that it follows the notation "H0" and "H1". My recommendation would be stating the hypothesis this way:

Null Hypothesis: The ratio of female bike riders during nightime (19.00-5.00) / the ratio of female bikers during daytime (5.00-19.00) is equal or greater than the ratio of male bikers during nightime (19.00-5.00) / men biking during daytime (5.00-19.00).

Alternative Hypothesis: The ratio of female bike riders during nightime (19.00-5.00) / the ratio of female bikers during daytime (5.00-19.00) is significantly (95% confidence level) smaller than the ratio of male bikers during nightime (19.00-5.00) / men biking during daytime (5.00-19.00).

### 3. The data processing was correct.
I think the data processing was correct, there might only be a little issue with the terminology, "women" is not equal to "female" and "men" is not equal to "male". But other than that minor issue I think not only the data processing is ok, but also the graphs shown. 

### 4. Recommended statistical test.
Given the experiment conditions, where the objective is to compare means of continuous variables (without an inteligible standard deviation because values can only take "Nightime" or "Daytime"), with a large sample for all groups I would recommend using a T test or a Pearson test.
