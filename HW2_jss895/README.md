This assignment was done with Julian Ferreiro (jif_245), with some support provided by Jack Lundquist and Dana Chermesh. 

First we started by downloading the data for only one bus line and understanding its format and how we could extract the information from it. When this was done we moved to making it work for every bus and making it automatically download the data (when requested) from the url given a API key and a bus line. For this step Jack helped us understand how the url downloading process works. Once we did this we had assignment 1 done.
For assignment 2 we realized that the raw code was very similar to the first assignment code, although we didn't know how to convert the output into a CSV file, Dana helped us understand this, although we ended up using a different approach, by converting the output into a dataframe, which we converted then into the CSV file.

We used Pandas, which was not installed in my machine so I ran the code for the second assignment in "compute"

For the third assignment I worked with Jack and Julian, we all selected the same dataset but decided to plot different things, I had some issues uploading the notebook to github (it was not readable) but I after a trying a couple times it became readable.
