# HW_5_jss895 summary.

### Assignment 1.

For assignment 1 I worked with Julián Ferreiro, most of the assignment was easy to do and understandable, except for the part of using the chi square in order to find the best parameters to fit the distributions, it was not clear how that should be done.

### Assignment 2.

For this assignment I worked with Julián Ferreiro with help from Jack Lundquist, the instructions were a little difficult to understand, but once we understood them they were relatively easy to execute. The Chi Square test was a little confusing because all the results didn't rejected the Null Hypothesis, which is wierd given the other test results.

### Assignment 3.

I also worked with Julián for this assignment and compared results with Jack and Prince. This was the easiest assignment to understand, nontheless it is ##IMPORTANT## to say that the datasets were not linked to an environmental variable (extracredit), so you will find them umploaded to the homework folder as well.
