Plot made using the energy consumption data, provided by the NY Local Law 84 benchmarking information

In the graph we can see 4 dimensions plotted, in the X and Y axxis we have the Log of the total Co2 emissions by building and in the Y axxis we have the Logarithm of the Source Energy Use Intensity. The Colors in the graph represent if the building is located in Manhattan (Red) or in another Borough (Blue) and the size of the point represents the Energy Star Points that that specific building receives.

As expected the more energy consuming buildings have a smaller Energy Star Points in comparisson to the less energy consuming buildings. Regarding the Boro there is not a clear pattern. And of course there seems to be some positive correlation between the GHG Co2 emissions and the Energy Use Intensity.

It is also important to mention that the graph was made using a random sample for 200 buildings in new york after merging Pluto Data and the Local Law 84 for NYC. And performing some data cleaning.
