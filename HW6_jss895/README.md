For this homework I worked with Julián Ferreir, collaborating also with Jack Lundquist, Sarah and Prince. The first challenges we faced came from downloading the dataset, because first Julián and I tried to do it using the API, but that had fewer rows than when you downloaded it (Energy Consumption). After getting this done we had started working with the rest of the homework, it was very challenging to fit the line properly for the log-log models, and finally when working with the second degree model we had some very strange results. The R2 was better but the line didn't seem to fit so well, nevertheless when doing the LR test and rejecting the Null, it seems to be a better model.
