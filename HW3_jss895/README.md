For the first assignment I worked wit Julián Ferreiro and Sarah. Sarah and I started exploring how to work with the distributions while Julián figured out the way to generate many distributions of one kind without having to create each of them individually. Once this was done we worked together to generate the different plots that were needed.

For the second assignment the people that I worked with were the same, most of the debate went around analyzing the variables we had available in order to generate a relatively easy to demonstrate hypothesis, so we decided we wanted to go with the effect of gender on the average triptime. Once this was decided we worked together to generate the different elements that were required.

Lab 3 was mostly done in class, I just added a couple markdowns to make it more readable.
